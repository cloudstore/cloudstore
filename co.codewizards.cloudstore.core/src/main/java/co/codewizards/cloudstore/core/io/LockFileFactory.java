	 * Acquire an exclusive lock on the specified file.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Important:</b> You <i>must</i> invoke {@link LockFile#release()} on the returned object! Use a try-finally-block
	 * to ensure it:
	 * <pre>  LockFile lockFile = LockFileFactory.getInstance().acquire(theFile, theTimeout);
	 *  try {
	 *    // do something
	 *  } finally {
	 *    lockFile.release();
	 *  }</pre>
	 * <p>
	 * Since Java 7, it is alternatively possible to use the try-with-resources clause like this:
	 * <pre>  try ( LockFile lockFile = LockFileFactory.getInstance().acquire(theFile, theTimeout); ) {
	 *    // do something while the file represented by 'lockFile' is locked.
	 *  }</pre>
	 * <p>
	 * If the JVM is interrupted or shut down before {@code release()}, the file-lock is released by the
	 * operating system, but a missing {@code release()} causes the file to be locked for the entire remaining runtime
	 * of the JVM! This problem does not exist using the new try-with-resources-clause (since Java 7).
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Important:</b> This is <i>not</i> usable for the synchronization of multiple threads within the same Java virtual machine!
	 * Multiple {@link LockFile}s on the same {@link File} are possible within the same JVM! This locking mechanism
	 * only locks against separate processes! Since this implementation is based on {@link java.nio.channels.FileLock FileLock},
	 * please consult its Javadoc for further information.
	 * <p>
	 * To make it possible to synchronise multiple threads in the same JVM, too, there's {@link LockFile#getLock()}.
	 * <p>
	 * Multiple invocations of this method on the same given {@code file} return multiple different {@code LockFile} instances.
	 * The actual lock is held until the last {@code LockFile} instance was {@linkplain LockFile#release() released}.
	 * <p>
	 * This method is thread-safe.
	 * @param file the file to be locked. Must not be <code>null</code>. If this file does not exist in the file system,
	 * it is created by this method.
	 * @param timeoutMillis the timeout to wait for the lock to be acquired in milliseconds. The value 0 means to
	 * wait forever.
	 * @return the {@code LockFile}. Never <code>null</code>. This <i>must</i> be
	 * {@linkplain java.nio.channels.FileLock#release() released}
	 * (use a try-finally-block)!
	 * @throws TimeoutException if the {@code LockFile} could not be acquired within the timeout specified by {@code timeoutMillis}.
	 * @see LockFile#release()
