Releases
-------

As development continues, CloudStore changes. Hence, we provide the corresponding web-site-version for each release.

Please make sure that you\'re reading the correct documentation for the version you\'re using. You
find the version of the web-site in the footer.

$H$H$H$H Java 11 vs. Java 8

Since version 1.0.0, CloudStore supports Java 11 and all its JARs contain a <code>module-java.class</code>.

CloudStore 1.0.0 should work with both Java 11 and Java 8 (actually even Java 7 should still be supported). But this was
not yet properly tested. Therefore, we currently do not (yet) automatically update from CloudStore 0.x.

If you freshly download & install CloudStore 1.x and encounter problems with Java 8 (or 7), please give version 0.x
a try.
